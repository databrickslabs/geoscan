*DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is a clustering technique used to group points that
are closely packed together. Compared to other clustering methodologies, it doesn't require you to indicate the number
of clusters beforehand, can detect clusters of varying shapes and sizes and is strong at finding outliers that don't
belong to any cluster, hence a great candidate for geospatial analysis of card transactions and fraud detection.
This, however, comes with a serious price tag: DBSCAN requires all points to be compared
to every other points in order to find dense neighborhoods where at least `minPts` points can be found within a
`epsilon` radius.* 

Here comes **GEOSCAN**, our novel approach to DBSCAN algorithm for geospatial clustering, 
leveraging uber [H3](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) library to only group points we know are in close vicinity (according 
to H3 precision) and relying on [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html) to detect 
dense areas at massive scale. With such a framework, Financial services institutions can better understand user 
shopping behaviours and detect anomalous transactions in real time.

### Usage

There are 2 modes our framework can be executed, **distributed** and **pseudo-distributed**.

#### Distributed

Working **fully distributed**, we retrieve clusters from an entire dataframe using the Spark `Estimator` interface, 
hence fully compliant with the Spark Pipeline framework (model can be serialized / deserialized). 
In this mode, the core of GEOSCAN algorithm relies on `GraphX` to detect points having `distance < epsilon` and a `degree > minPoints`. 
See the next section for an explanation of our algorithm.

#### Usage

```python
from geoscan import Geoscan

geoscan = Geoscan() \
    .setLatitudeCol("latitude") \
    .setLongitudeCol("longitude") \
    .setPredictionCol("cluster") \
    .setEpsilon(100) \
    .setMinPts(3)

model = geoscan.fit(points_df)
```


| parameter     | description                                     | default   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| epsilon       | the minimum distance in meters between 2 points | 50        |
| minPts        | the minimum number of neighbours within epsilon | 3         |
| latitudeCol   | the latitude column                             | latitude  |
| longitudeCol  | the longitude column                            | longitude |
| predictionCol | the resulted prediction column                  | predicted |


As the core of GEOSCAN logic relies on the use of H3 polygons, it becomes natural to leverage the same for model 
inference instead of bringing in extra GIS dependencies for expensive point in polygons queries. Our model consists 
in clusters tiled with hexagons of a given resolution (driven by the `epsilon` parameter) that can easily be joined to our original dataframe. 
Model inference is fully supported as per the `Estimator` interface

```python
model.transform(points_df)
```

Note that when saving model to distributed file system, we converted our shapes into [GeoJson](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) RFC 7946 
format so that clusters could be loaded as-is into GIS databases or any downstream application or libraries. 

```python
from geoscan import GeoscanModel
model.save('/tmp/geoscan_model/distributed')
model = GeoscanModel.load('/tmp/geoscan_model/distributed')
```

Model can always be returned as a GeoJson object directly

```python
model.toGeoJson()
```

Finally, it may be useful to extract clusters as a series of H3 tiles that could be used outside a spark environment or outside GEOSCAN library.
We expose a `getTiles` method that fills all our polygons with H3 tiles of a given dimension, allowing shapes to spill over additional layers should
we want to also "capture" neighbours points.

```python
model.getTiles(precision, additional_layers)
```

This process can be summarized with below picture. Note that although a higher granularity would
fit a polygon better, the number of tiles it generates will grow exponentially.

#### Pseudo Distributed

It is fairly common to extract personalized clusters (e.g. for each user), and doing so sequentially would be terribly inefficient.
For that purpose, we extended our GEOSCAN class to support `RelationalGroupedDataset` and train multiple models in parallel, one for each group attribute. 
Although the implementation is different (using in-memory `scalax.collection.Graph` instead of distributed `GraphX`), 
the core logic remains the same as explained in the next section and should yield the same clusters given a same user.

#### Usage

One must provide a new parameter `groupedCol` to indicate our framework how to group dataframe and train multiple models in parallel.

```python
from geoscan import GeoscanPersonalized

geoscan = Geoscan() \
    .setLatitudeCol("latitude") \
    .setLongitudeCol("longitude") \
    .setPredictionCol("cluster") \
    .setGroupedCol("user") \
    .setEpsilon(100) \
    .setMinPts(3)

model = geoscan.fit(points_df)
```

Note that the output signature differs from the distributed approach since we cannot return a single model but a collection of GEOJSON objects

```python
model.toGeoJson().show()
```

```
+--------------------+--------------------+
|                user|             cluster|
+--------------------+--------------------+
|72fc865a-0c34-409...|{"type":"FeatureC...|
|cc227e67-c6d1-40a...|{"type":"FeatureC...|
|9cafdb6d-9134-4ee...|{"type":"FeatureC...|
|804c7fa2-8063-4ba...|{"type":"FeatureC...|
|65bd17be-b030-44a...|{"type":"FeatureC...|
+--------------------+--------------------+
```

Note that standard `transform` and `getTiles` methods also apply in that mode. By tracking how tiles change overtime, 
this framework can be used to detect user changing behaviour as represented in below animation using synthetic data.

### Installation

Compile GEOSCAN scala library that can be uploaded onto a Databricks cluster (DBR > 9.1). Activate `shaded` profile 
to include GEOSCAN dependencies as an assembly jar if needed

```shell
mvn clean package -Pshaded
```

Alternatively (preferred), install dependency from maven central directly in your spark based environment.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.databricks.labs</groupId>
    <artifactId>geoscan</artifactId>
    <version>0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

For python users, install the dependencies from pypi in addition to the above scala dependency.

```shell script
pip install geoscan==0.1
```

### Release process

Once a change is approved, peer reviewed and merged back to `master` branch, a project admin will be able to promote 
a new version to both maven central and pypi repo as a manual github action.
See `release.yaml` github action.
